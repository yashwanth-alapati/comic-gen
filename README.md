NOTE: I'm working on writing proper documentation for the project and the tech-stack as well.

Gist of what the project is about:

We have built a Retreival Augmented Generation project using MongoDB Atlas search. For inference we have employed quantized mistral 7b model. We have use stability AI's latest diffusion model

If you have a story,a comic-book or manga. You can ingest it into the Vecotr databse and our RAG model will generate fan fiction comics. Scroll down the ipynb notebook to see the end result
