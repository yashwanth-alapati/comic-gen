We have built this project as part of MongoDB GenAI hacakthon in New York. While we have the backend code ready, we are actively working on building the application. 

A small Introduction to the project:

Our creation - ComicGen, is a RAG-based scene generation model that can create comic-book-style renderings of fan theories and plot extensions. Using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search we vectorize and store a large repository of open-access books, which can be queried by a user for alternative plots or creative story generation. Using Stability AI's Stable Diffusion 1.0, we generate comic strips in a user-specified illustration style. 

Nomic AI's embedding model on top of LangChain, combined with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search forms the base of our RAG model. This conjuncted with Mistral AI's Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 taken from Hugging Face generates fine-tuned scripts and scenes. These scenes are fed into the Stable Diffusion model to iteratively generate comic illustrations and rendered using Pillow.

Some Comics generated by our model:
